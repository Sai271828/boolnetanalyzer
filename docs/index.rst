Boolean Network Analyzer
=============

This package is a collection of mathematical tools to analyze Boolean networks.
Boolean networks are a class of discrete dynamical systems that are used to model gene regulatory networks.
The package provides tools to generate random Boolean networks, analyze their dynamics, and load networks from files.

The package is organized into the following modules:

* :mod:`boolnetanalyzer.utils` - Utility functions

* :mod:`boolnetanalyzer.random_networks` - Functions to generate random Boolean networks

* :mod:`boolnetanalyzer.bn_tools` - Functions to analyze Boolean networks

* :mod:`boolnetanalyzer.load` - Functions to load Boolean networks from files

The package is developed by the Laboratory for Systems Medicine at the University of Florida.
